## ❓ Common Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my data safe?</strong></summary>

Absolutely! Your Amazing Marvin data stays between you, Amazing Marvin, and your AI assistant. The connection runs on your computer - nothing is stored on external servers or shared with anyone else.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Which AI assistants work with this?</strong></summary>

Any AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol, including Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, and Windsurf. More are being added regularly.
</details>

<details>

Not noticeably. The system fetches your data from Amazing Marvin when you ask productivity questions. Response time depends on your internet connection, but it's usually very quick.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can my AI assistant change my tasks?</strong></summary>

Yes, if you ask it to! Your AI can:
- ✅ Create new tasks and projects
- ✅ Mark tasks as done
- ✅ Start and stop time tracking
- ✅ Organize tasks in batches

Don't worry - it only makes changes when you specifically ask it to.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I see completed tasks?</strong></summary>

Yes! The MCP can find and display completed tasks in several ways:

**📊 In Daily Focus View:**
- ✅ Shows today's completed tasks alongside pending ones
- ✅ Includes completion count and productivity notes
- ✅ Separates completed from pending for clear progress tracking

**📁 In Project Overviews:**
- ✅ Lists completed vs pending tasks separately
- ✅ Shows completion rate and progress summary
- ✅ Provides detailed task breakdowns

**🔍 Efficient Historical Access:**
- ✅ Get completed tasks for any specific date (e.g., "June 10th")
- ✅ Flexible time range summaries (1 day, 7 days, 30 days, or custom date ranges)
- ✅ **Complete task data included** - no additional API calls needed for task details
- ✅ **Smart caching** - historical data cached for 10 minutes to avoid redundant calls
- ✅ Project-wise completion analytics with resolved project names
- ✅ Efficient API filtering with cache hit rate tracking
- ✅ Real-time access to completion timestamps and project correlations
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What can't the MCP do?</strong></summary>

**🚫 Cannot Delete or Remove (without full-access token):**
- ❌ Delete tasks — hidden unless `AMAZING_MARVIN_FULL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set
- ❌ Delete projects or categories — same requirement
- ❌ Remove labels or goals
- ❌ Clear time tracking history

Setting `AMAZING_MARVIN_FULL_ACCESS_TOKEN` unlocks: `delete_document`, `get_document`, `update_document`, `update_task`.

**📝 Cannot Edit (without full-access token):**
- ❌ Modify existing task content (title, notes, due dates)
- ❌ Move tasks between projects
- ❌ Change task priorities or labels
- ❌ Update project settings

**📚 Limited Access:**
- ❌ Full historical completed task archive
- ❌ Detailed time tracking reports (only basic tracking)
- ❌ Private notes or sensitive data
- ❌ Advanced Amazing Marvin features (strategies, rewards setup)

For these operations, use the Amazing Marvin app directly.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How often is the data updated?</strong></summary>

Data is fetched in real-time with each request to Amazing Marvin's API. There's no background syncing or caching - you always get the most current data from your Amazing Marvin account.
</details>

## 👨‍💻 Development

### 🛠️ Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bgheneti/Amazing-Marvin-MCP.git
cd Amazing-Marvin-MCP
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```

### 🔑 Set your API key

**Option A: Environment variable**
```bash
export AMAZING_MARVIN_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

**Option B: Create a `.env` file**
```env
AMAZING_MARVIN_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 🔐 Optional: Full-access token

The standard API key covers most read operations and basic writes. A **full-access token** is required for the four mutative document tools: `get_document`, `update_document`, `delete_document`, and `update_task`. Without it these tools are simply absent from the MCP tool list.

**Where to get it:** open [https://app.amazingmarvin.com/pre?api](https://app.amazingmarvin.com/pre?api) or the in-app **Strategies → Sync & API** panel. Copy the value labeled **Full Access Token**.

Add to your environment or `.env` file:
```env
AMAZING_MARVIN_FULL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-full-access-token-here
```

### 🗄️ Optional: Direct database access (advanced)

Amazing Marvin exposes its underlying CouchDB/Cloudant database for direct access. When configured, this unlocks a `query_docs` tool with rich filtering and field projection, and makes several existing tools faster by replacing multiple REST calls with a single database query.

**Where to get credentials:** open [https://app.amazingmarvin.com/pre?api](https://app.amazingmarvin.com/pre?api) or the in-app **Strategies → Sync & API** panel. Both surfaces show four values labeled Sync Server, Sync Database, Sync User, Sync Password. Map them like this:

| Marvin field      | Env var                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Sync Server (URL) | `AMAZING_MARVIN_DB_URI`      |
| Sync Database     | `AMAZING_MARVIN_DB_NAME`     |
| Sync User         | `AMAZING_MARVIN_DB_USER`     |
| Sync Password     | `AMAZING_MARVIN_DB_PASSWORD` |

All four are required — if any is missing, the DB-backed tools are silently unavailable and behavior falls back to REST.

Add to your environment or `.env` file:
```env
AMAZING_MARVIN_DB_URI=https://...
AMAZING_MARVIN_DB_NAME=<your-db-name>
AMAZING_MARVIN_DB_USER=<your-db-user>
AMAZING_MARVIN_DB_PASSWORD=<your-db-password>
```

**Note:** Direct database access is read-only in this integration. All writes continue through the REST API, matching Marvin's own guidance.

**Rate limits apply:** Marvin's guidance is ≤1 query per 3 seconds and ≤1440 queries per day for both REST and direct DB access. Avoid tight loops.

**Performance note:** On large accounts, queries may benefit from Mango indexes. Marvin's Sync credentials don't have permission to create them (they're read-only). Defaults work for typical account sizes; if you self-host CouchDB or have elevated credentials, create indexes manually via your Cloudant dashboard.

### 🧪 Testing
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

**⚠️ Note**: Tests create temporary items in your Amazing Marvin account with `[TEST]` prefixes. These may need manual cleanup due to API limitations.

### 📋 Code Quality
